## Environment Requirements

### Host Environment
- **OS:** Linux

### Docker Setup
Ensure Docker is installed on your Jetson device.
The following versions are recommended:
- **Docker Engine:** v20.10.x or later
- **docker-compose:** v1.28.x or later

#### Check if Docker is Installed
Run the following command to verify Docker installation:
```bash
sudo docker --version
```

#### If Docker is not installed, follow these steps:

1. **Set Up Docker's APT Repository**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```

Add the Docker repository to your APT sources:
```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

2. **Install Docker Packages**
```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

3. **Verify Docker Service**
Check if Docker is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

### Run Docker Without sudo

To allow the current user to execute Docker commands without using sudo:

1. **Add User to Docker Group**
```bash
sudo groupadd docker       # Create the docker group if it doesn't exist
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

2. **Apply Group Changes**
```bash
newgrp docker
```

3. **Verify User**
```bash
echo $USER
```

4. **Update Docker Socket Permissions**
```bash
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
```

After this, you should be able to run Docker commands without sudo.
You may need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

## Installation Requirements

```

## Quick Start / Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Advantech-EdgeSync-Containers/WebOccult-Intrusion-Detection.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
```bash
cd WebOccult-Intrusion-Detection
```

3. **Make the run script executable**
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
```

4. **Run the project**
```bash
./run.sh
```

The `run.sh` script will automatically start the necessary services using Docker Compose as defined in `docker-compose.yaml`.

After running this, the project will be up and ready to use.

## Application Usage

### Example to run
<!-- Result video -->
<!-- <insert video here> -->

### Functionality:
- Continuously monitors designated areas using live video feeds
- **Difference between two levels of intrusion zones:**
  - **Critical ROI (Danger Zone):** Alerts are sent more frequently and faster, as this region represents a high-risk or dangerous area
  - **Normal ROI (Warning Zone):** Alerts are sent less frequently, indicating a potential but non-critical intrusion

## Troubleshooting

For common issues and solutions, please refer to the troubleshooting section or contact support at **sales@weboccult.com**.

## Future Work

The system can be further enhanced to improve video compatibility, detection accuracy, performance, and monitoring capabilities:

- 🎥 Enable broader video format compatibility and streaming using FFmpeg support
- 🎯 Improve model accuracy and reliability through enhanced person detection
- ⚡ Optimize performance by implementing multiprocessing for parallel detection and processing
- ⏰ Introduce timed intrusion detection to monitor intrusions within specific time intervals
- 🎯 Support multiple regions of interest (ROIs) for more granular alert management
- 🔧 Refine code and processing pipeline for faster and more efficient operation
